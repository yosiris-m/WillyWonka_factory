## ‚úÖ Requirements 

This project is useful to show the Willy Wonka ice creams. The use cases are:
- Show ice cream list
- Show ice cream detail
- Filter ice cream by full-text search
- Change the ice cream list sort order
- Add ice cream to favorites
- Remove ice cream from favorites

The application has two screen:
- **Ice Cream List**: Shows a list with all ice creams. You can look for a specified ice cream using the filter component and change the sort oder.
- **Ice Cream Details**: Shows the ice cream details and add (or remove) to favorites.

To take into account:
- I am using the [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to persist the favorites.
- I am filtering and sorting the list items using the JSON Server features:
  - [Full-text Search](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#full-text-search)
  - [Sort](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#sort)
